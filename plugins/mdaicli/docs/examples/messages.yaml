      I'm working on a web application and need help with authentication.
      What are the best practices for implementing secure user authentication in 2024?

      Here are the key best practices for secure authentication in 2024:
      
      1. **Use Strong Password Policies**
         - Minimum 12 characters
         - Require complexity without predictable patterns
         - Check against compromised password databases
      
      2. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
         - TOTP/HOTP authenticators preferred
         - WebAuthn/FIDO2 for passwordless options
         - SMS only as fallback (not primary)
      
      3. **Secure Password Storage**
         - Use Argon2id, scrypt, or bcrypt
         - Never store plain text or reversible encryption
         - Use appropriate work factors
      
      4. **Session Management**
         - Generate cryptographically secure session tokens
         - Implement proper session expiration
         - Use secure, httpOnly, sameSite cookies
      
      5. **Rate Limiting and Brute Force Protection**
         - Implement exponential backoff
         - Use CAPTCHA after failed attempts
         - Consider account lockouts with recovery
      
      Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or discuss implementation details for a specific framework?
