      "content": "Here are the key best practices for secure authentication in 2024:\n\n1. **Use Strong Password Policies**\n   - Minimum 12 characters\n   - Require complexity without predictable patterns\n   - Check against compromised password databases\n\n2. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**\n   - TOTP/HOTP authenticators preferred\n   - WebAuthn/FIDO2 for passwordless options\n   - SMS only as fallback (not primary)\n\n3. **Secure Password Storage**\n   - Use Argon2id, scrypt, or bcrypt\n   - Never store plain text or reversible encryption\n   - Use appropriate work factors\n\n4. **Session Management**\n   - Generate cryptographically secure session tokens\n   - Implement proper session expiration\n   - Use secure, httpOnly, sameSite cookies\n\n5. **Rate Limiting and Brute Force Protection**\n   - Implement exponential backoff\n   - Use CAPTCHA after failed attempts\n   - Consider account lockouts with recovery\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these points or discuss implementation details for a specific framework?"
